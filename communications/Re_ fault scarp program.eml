HI Mark,

Saturday was good, though not quite the results I wanted.  The course was u=
pstream from the Head of the Charles course =97 the start was just downstre=
am from the Anderson Bridge (near Harvard Square), and went 3 miles upstrea=
m to just above the Beacon Street Bridge in Watertown, near the CRI boathou=
se.    I raced twice.  The first race was the Women=92s Masters 8+ and we f=
inished 4th.  Masters races are handicapped by the average age of the rower=
s in the boat, so after handicap we were just 7 seconds out of third.  Howe=
ver, coming through the Eliot Bridge (or was it the Arsenal Street Bridge?)=
 we had to hold up (take the pressure off) because another boat was passing=
 under the bridge and race course rules said just one boat under a bridge a=
t a time (unlike Head of the Charles).  That could well have cost us the 7 =
seconds. Of course, no saying about the 3rd place boat; it might have had a=
 similar delay=85 Still, we raced well, but I would have liked a medal.  In=
 my other race, it was the Womens Masters 4+, and my boat was three of the =
less experienced rowers plus me (presumably for experience and stability). =
 For that lineup, we had a good race, holding off a 4+ behind us for the en=
tire race, but we ended up 9th of 10.  I was a little tired after the two r=
aces, each 20+ minutes long=97 just a little ;-))

OK, fault scarp code:

Boundary conditions are constant gradient, dh/dx =3D constant, with the slo=
pes given by  segments 1 and 3 of the initial condition (IC).  That=92s why=
 students are told to make sure they get enough data points on the  fan abo=
ve and below the scarp, so they can accurately fix segments 1 and 3 of the =
IC.

IC are done in  the Java code by dragging line segments that represent the =
fan below the scarp, the scarp, and the fan above the scarp.  One can add l=
ine segments if desired (shouldn=92t normally be necessary, but perhaps if =
one had a complex scarp made by 2 temporally distinct earthquakes there mig=
ht be a need) or delete line segments.  Line segments can be dragged using =
the point at their middle, or their slopes can be changed by dragging endpo=
ints.  This was Nick=92s idea to do, and it=92s one of the best aspects of =
the program=97 you don=92t have to calculate slopes and distances laborious=
ly from the observational data to construct the IC, you can do it with just=
 a few clicks and drags.  What=92s missing is being able to plot the IC wit=
h no vertical exaggeration, to be able to compare with one=92s memory of th=
e field, to have  slope angles for the line segments displayed (so one can =
see if the scarp dip is near 60 deg, theoretically the dip of a normal faul=
t, and to have lengths of segments displayed (to give amount of slip on the=
 fault). I made a start at specifying slopes and lengths in the Matlab code=
, but it=92s ugly.

The solution of the differential equation is an explicit finite difference =
method, which requires a stability condition. That is why we have all the l=
imericks, haiku, and other poetry (yes, science nerds rejoice!)  about the =
Courant condition (kappa*dt/dx/dx < 0.5).  Originally when Nick Sherman (D =
=9298) wrote the Java code, I thought it would be good for students to know=
 something about numerical methods, so I made setting the Courant criterion=
 explicit.  However,  while I still think it=92s important to understand ho=
w to numerically solve a differential equation, I=92ve also realized that t=
his program is not the place to do it and the poetry is more of  a distract=
ion than an educational aid.  So in the new code I=92d prefer to not distra=
ct the students, but rather set the Courant condition automatically.  I=92d=
 consider, perhaps, plotting one number by each curve (or elsewhere) that i=
s the RMS residual between curve and observational data, just as I do with =
Grav GUI, but am not sure.

I don=92t think it=92s a good idea to automatically generate a best-fit sol=
ution, for several reasons.  First, the data are sparse enough that any alg=
orithm (e.g. least squares) is not going to give any better insight than ey=
eballing will.  And second, automatic selection of the best-fit will make p=
eople stupid =97 I.e. they=92ll stop comparing data and solutions, and rath=
er, will just arbitrarily jump at the =93best fit=94, or worse, make the IC=
 more and more complex and geologically unjustifiable, just  to get a sligh=
tly better RMS residual.  Instead of generating a best-fit solution, I=92d =
let people choose up to 5 times to plot curves for and compare with observa=
tional data (more than 5 curves plotted makes for messy plots, fewer than 5=
 is OK but perhaps a bit harder to bracket the best time) .  Whether those =
times are selected by sliders  (as in the Java code) or by typing in number=
s (as in my unfinished Matlab code) doesn=92t really matter.

Data entry:   The Java code had students input x and y coordinates into a d=
ata table.  In the Matlab code, I first thought about doing the same, but t=
hen commented it out and instead, was just going to have students create a =
text file with 2 columns of data (x and y coordinates) delimited by spaces.=
 The latter is  simple and also is exactly the same method used to enter gr=
avity data in GravGUI, so easy and familiar.  The Java data table was fine,=
 except that Java required all numbers to be followed by =93Enter=94, other=
wise they wouldn=92t be seen by the code. (Incidentally, that=92s probably =
why you got the error about setting a positive time in the range control =
=97you probably input a time but didn=92t hit enter.  Same with the min and=
 max values for the graph =97 they need to be input followed by =93enter=94=
.)

The result of the Java code is 5 curves plotted on the graph, along with th=
e data. Curves are color coordinated with slider times so that the students=
 can see ages.  In Matlab, I anticipated using the legend command, as well =
as color coordinating with the =93times to plot=94.

In the Matlab code, as I said above, I=92d given up on the sliders, as too =
hard to program and not particularly better than just inputting 5 times to =
plot.  The layout should be obvious if you start up the Matlab version =97 =
all graphs and parameter entry are visible. The rightmost menu item (at top=
 of window) allows data files to be read, as well as old calculations to be=
 saved or read back in.  I hadn=92t yet implemented all the menu items yet.

Of course, the biggest problem with the Matlab code was with the IC =97 the=
 drag-and-drop aspect. I had it working  OK, but not great =97 it might tak=
e repeated clicks to get it going, but after that it worked, and the slopes=
 and lengths of the line segments, as well as coordinates of line segment e=
ndpoints, updated continuously.  However, I then added in plotting the obse=
rvational data, and for reasons I haven=92t yet figured out, it made the dr=
ag/drop stop working.  That=92s when I realized I might be a little over my=
 head with this code=85.

I=92m not sure there are any additional features I need =97 the code should=
 be as simple as possible, to avoid distracting students from the task at h=
and, namely to compare calculated curves with observational data to estimat=
e scarp age. Hence hiding the Courant condition and keeping the interface a=
s spare as reasonably possible.  Students should be able to print a window =
with graph of data, calculated curves (with ages labelled),  and kappa (dif=
fusion constant) clearly indicated, to include with their fault scarp repor=
t.  (Note that=92s another problem with the old code =97 on the printout, a=
xis labels and numbers don=92t plot, the plot has different horizontal and =
vertical scales, and the value of kappa is not shown.)

 I=92d be open to ideas you might have !

Make sense?

Hi Leslie,

How was your Saturday on the Charles? I saw some cars lined up but didn=92t=
 see any boats when I was nearby.

I=92ve been looking at some of the fault scarp code and I=92m able to launc=
h the .jar version on my Mac, so I can play around with it. If I can find a=
 good amount of time I think there=92s a chance I could have a working vers=
ion by late October, but no guarantees. Before I get started I want to make=
 sure I fully understand it. Do you think you could send me a brief write-u=
p of things like:

1) How the boundary conditions of the diffusion equation are defined. I hap=
pen to have a good amount of experience with 1D solutions to the diffusion/=
heat equation (from a project at work) so I don=92t anticipate any problem =
understanding that part of it. I could try to parse the existing code but i=
t=92s easier just to ask. I remember that solutions for certain time interv=
als are displayed and students can choose which one fits best by eye. I cou=
ld also write up a method that will find the optimal solution automatically=
, but I know that would less interactive and probably pedagogically poor. M=
aybe there could be a =93Find Optimal Solution=94 button in addition to the=
 tools for finding a good fit by eye.

2) Input/Output. What input methods should the program support? It looks li=
ke it currently supports reading from delimited text and typing into the da=
ta table in the GUI, which makes sense to me. What form does the output tak=
e though? I haven=92t actually gotten it to =93Run Calc=85=94 because it ke=
eps telling me to =93Please set a positive time in the range control,=94 wh=
ich I think I=92ve done.

3) Do you want all the same features (buttons, sliders, etc.)? Are there an=
y improvements or additions you want made?

comparing data and solutions, and rather, will just arbitrarily jump at the=
 =93best fit=94, or worse, make the IC more and more complex and geological=
ly unjustifiable, just &nbsp;to get a slightly
 better RMS residual. &nbsp;Instead of generating a best-fit solution, I=92=
d let people choose up to 5 times to plot curves for and compare with obser=
vational data (more than 5 curves plotted makes for messy plots, fewer than=
 5 is OK but perhaps a bit harder to bracket
 the best time) . &nbsp;Whether those times are selected by sliders &nbsp;(=
as in the Java code) or by typing in numbers (as in my unfinished Matlab co=
de) doesn=92t really matter. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Data entry: &nbsp; The Java code had students input x and y coordinate=
s into a data table. &nbsp;In the Matlab code, I first thought about doing =
the same, but then commented it out and instead, was just going to have stu=
dents create a text file with 2 columns of
 data (x and y coordinates) delimited by spaces. The latter is &nbsp;simple=
 and also is exactly the same method used to enter gravity data in GravGUI,=
 so easy and familiar. &nbsp;The Java data table was fine, except that Java=
 required all numbers to be followed by =93Enter=94,
 otherwise they wouldn=92t be seen by the code. (Incidentally, that=92s pro=
bably why you got the error about setting a positive time in the range cont=
rol =97you probably input a time but didn=92t hit enter. &nbsp;Same with th=
e min and max values for the graph =97 they need
 to be input followed by =93enter=94.)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The result of the Java code is 5 curves plotted on the graph, along wi=
th the data. Curves are color coordinated with slider times so that the stu=
dents can see ages. &nbsp;In Matlab, I anticipated using the legend command=
, as well as color coordinating with
 the =93times to plot=94. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In the Matlab code, as I said above, I=92d given up on the sliders, as=
 too hard to program and not particularly better than just inputting 5 time=
s to plot. &nbsp;The layout should be obvious if you start up the Matlab ve=
rsion =97 all graphs and parameter entry
 are visible. The rightmost menu item (at top of window) allows data files =
to be read, as well as old calculations to be saved or read back in. &nbsp;=
I hadn=92t yet implemented all the menu items yet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Of course, the biggest problem with the Matlab code was with the IC =
=97 the drag-and-drop aspect. I had it working &nbsp;OK, but not great =97 =
it might take repeated clicks to get it going, but after that it worked, an=
d the slopes and lengths of the line segments,
 as well as coordinates of line segment endpoints, updated continuously. &n=
bsp;However, I then added in plotting the observational data, and for reaso=
ns I haven=92t yet figured out, it made the drag/drop stop working. &nbsp;T=
hat=92s when I realized I might be a little over
 my head with this code=85.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I=92m not sure there are any additional features I need =97 the code s=
hould be as simple as possible, to avoid distracting students from the task=
 at hand, namely to compare calculated curves with observational data to es=
timate scarp age. Hence hiding the Courant
 condition and keeping the interface as spare as reasonably possible. &nbsp=
;Students should be able to print a window with graph of data, calculated c=
urves (with ages labelled), &nbsp;and kappa (diffusion constant) clearly in=
dicated, to include with their fault scarp
 report. &nbsp;(Note that=92s another problem with the old code =97 on the =
printout, axis labels and numbers don=92t plot, the plot has different hori=
zontal and vertical scales, and the value of kappa is not shown.)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I=92d be open to ideas you might have !&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Make sense?&nbsp;</div>

I=92ve been looking at some of the fault scarp code and I=92m able to launc=
h the .jar version on my Mac, so I can play around with it. If I can find a=
 good amount of time I think there=92s a chance I could have a working vers=
ion by late October, but no guarantees.
 Before I get started I want to make sure I fully understand it. Do you thi=
nk you could send me a brief write-up of things like:</div>

1) How the boundary conditions of the diffusion equation are defined. I hap=
pen to have a good amount of experience with 1D solutions to the diffusion/=
heat equation (from a project at work) so I don=92t anticipate any problem =
understanding that part of it. I could
 try to parse the existing code but it=92s easier just to ask. I remember t=
hat solutions for certain time intervals are displayed and students can cho=
ose which one fits best by eye. I could also write up a method that will fi=
nd the optimal solution automatically,
 but I know that would less interactive and probably pedagogically poor. Ma=
ybe there could be a =93Find Optimal Solution=94 button in addition to the =
tools for finding a good fit by eye.</div>

2) Input/Output. What input methods should the program support? It looks li=
ke it currently supports reading from delimited text and typing into the da=
ta table in the GUI, which makes sense to me. What form does the output tak=
e though? I haven=92t actually gotten
 it to =93Run Calc=85=94 because it keeps telling me to =93Please set a pos=
itive time in the range control,=94 which I think I=92ve done.</div>
